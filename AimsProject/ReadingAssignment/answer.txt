Section 9: Constructors of whole classes and parent classes
*Question: Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?

Section 12: Sort media in the cart
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
*Question: What class should implement the Comparable interface?

*Question: In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?

*Question: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?

*Question: -	Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
