*Question 1: Reading Assignment:  When should accessor methods be used?

There are situations where accessor methods might be necessary:

- Interface Return Types: Itâ€™s acceptable for a method to return an object in terms of an interface it implements, as this isolates you from changes to the implementing class1.
- Boundary Layers: Accessor methods are often unavoidable in boundary layers, such as when interfacing with procedural systems or databases.
- UI Construction: In user interface construction, accessors can be used if they return complex objects with behavior, not just fields.

The main takeaway is to use accessors sparingly and only when absolutely necessary to maintain encapsulation and reduce maintenance complexity.

*Question 2: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- Yes, Java allows us to create multiple constructors for the same class, a feature known as constructor overloading. We can have multiple constructors as long as they have different parameter lists.
